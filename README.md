# Large-deviation
It is fairly straightforward to simulate atypical, rare trajectories of dynamical systems in an efficient, accelerated manner. We demonstrated a computing technique for studying such rare events in stochastic systems.
The strategy is based on the evolution of a family of system copies that are replicated or killed in such a way
that the atypical trajectories are more likely to be realized. We show this in particular for large deviations in a
non-equilibrium stochastic transport model called the Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process. The main observables
in this model (such as the current, density, and so on) are functions of a Discrete-Time Markov chainâ€™s sample
path in a high-dimensional state space.
